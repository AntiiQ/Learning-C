pointer arithmetic is NOT better than subscripting, not at all
it was at one point, like 40 years ago but not anymore

its all situational so like use whatever seems easier at the time
and be able to read code that has both

a[i] and i[a] are equivalent because fuck you

in parameter declarations *a and a[] are equivalent in a parameter declarations
as bith ahave the same type and suggest to the compiler that a is likely to be changed
both methods work and are used, but some say *a is more clear, or more ambiguos?


the name of an array is not actually a pointer, it can just act as one if needed
for exaple sizeof(a) would return the total number of bytes in the attay (size of element * num of element)
sizeof(p) would be the number of bytes required to store a pointer value

the addres that a and a[0] point to may be the same but the both have diffrent types
a is a pointer to an array
a[0] is a pointer to an int which can be casted to an int

you cant add pointer together just subtract them
